</div>
<p>n a small town by
the side of a lake,
there once lived
two dogs named
Mop and Frisk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
    Frisk was a pert black and
tan dog, with a tail that stood
bolt up in the air, and a pair
of ears to match; while Mop
was a poor old cur, with a
head like a worn-out hair-broom;
ears like bell-pulls;
a mouth that went from ear
to ear, and a great bush of a
tail. Then he had to drag
the cart of an old rag-man
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
round the town, to earn his
meals; while Frisk, who lived
with a pie-man, had a fine
ride in the cart each morn;
and all the work he had to do
was to bark at the bad boys
who tried to steal the pies.
The rest of his time he spent
in play.</p>

<p>One day the old rag-man,
who was as cross as ten bears,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and far too fond of beer, came
out of a shop where he had
been to drink, while poor Mop
had to wait in the cold. The
rag-man's legs went from side
to side; he could not walk;
so he got in the cart, on top
of all the rags, and cried to
Mop:</p>

<p>"Come, go on, you bad
cur, or I'll make you!" and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with these words, he let fall
a great stick on the back of
the poor dog, and gave him
a kick with his thick hob-nail
shoes. Mop tried to start, but
it was more than he could
drag. Down came the stick
once more; and this time,
made quite wild with pain, he
gave one yelp and one jump,
broke the old ropes that held
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
him to the cart by a great
jerk, and made off down the
road like a flash. The bad
old man did bawl to him to
come back; but Mop was too
wise for that, and did not stop
to see if the wind was west
or not, till he came to a part
of the town which was quite
new to him.</p>

<p>The place where our dog
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
now found him-self was a
sort of blind court, with the
blank wall of a house on each
side, and, worse than all, with
not the sign of a thing to eat
to be seen.</p>

<p>"A fly to snap at would be
a good thing," said the poor
dog with a sigh. "I think I
could eat a bit of brick, if I
could get one up. But cheer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
up! it will all come right in
time! I'm <i>free</i> at least&mdash;that
is one good thing!" and he
gave three jumps and three
barks for joy, so loud that
they most took the top of
his head off.</p>

<p>Just then there came up, at
a smart pace, Frisk the pie-man's
dog. He held his head
in the air as proud as you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
like. When he saw Mop, he
tried to turn up his nose at
him, but it was so flat, there
was no turn up to it. Then
he gave a loud sniff, and said
with an air:</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where did
<i>you</i> come from?"</p>

<p>"I am as good a dog as
you," said Mop. "My coat is
not quite so fine to be sure,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and my ears don't stick up
so much; but I'm a nice sort
of chap for all that. Shake
a paw."</p>

<p>"What! shake a paw with
such an old flop-ear as you?
You must be mad."</p>

<p>Mop did want to say, "You
are a pert, stuck-up cur," but
he was too well-bred; so he
made a bow, and put his paw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
on his heart; and said: "I
meant no wrong; but I took
you for Frisk, the pie-man's
dog."</p>

<p>"Well, so I am&mdash;or so I
was, I mean; till last week;
but, you see, the trade was
too low for a dog of my style&mdash;with
such ears and such a
long tail. I was not made to
bark out of the back of a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
pie-cart at all the rag-tags in
town; so I have cut the pie-man,
and mean to try high
life in some big house. My
own aunt lives with a judge;
and it will be odd if some
rich man does not like my
looks, and take me home with
him. But I must be off; it
would not do to be seen with
you, if I hope to rise in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
world. A good time to you,
my boy. He! he! you are
such a beau, you can't fail to
cut a dash. G-o-o-d day!"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit!" cried Mop,
as Frisk ran off. "You don't
think much of me <i>now</i> I see,
but time may show me to be
the best dog yet. What if we
were each to try to find a new
place, and meet here in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
month from now, to tell what
has past in the mean time?
Don't you think that would
be a nice plan?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll do so if you
wish!" said Frisk; "but don't
ask me to bow when we meet,
I beg; it won't <i>do</i>, you know."</p>

<p>"Shake a paw then," said
Mop.</p>

<p>Frisk, very loth, put the tip
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of one claw on Mop's paw.
Then the two dogs stood back
to back, and, with a one!
two!! three!!! off they went
as if a mad bull was at their
heels.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>
<h3>THE DOGS MEET ONCE MORE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
    <a name="i003.jpg" id="i003.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i003.jpg" width="75" height="66" alt="Illustrated letter O" title="" />
</div>
<p>n the last day
of the month,
Mop and
Frisk, true to
their word, came to the place
where they last said good-by.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
But how each one did look to
see if his mate were the same
dog he last saw!</p>

<p>Mop's coat was rough no
more&mdash;it shone like silk; his
ears were cut; he wore a fine
brass neck ring, with a new
name on it; and his whole air
was that of a dog in luck.</p>

<p>Poor Frisk was so thin that
you could count all his ribs.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
His tail stood up in the air no
more. He hung his head and
crept close by the wall, as if
he did fear some one would
beat him if he dared to run
or jump.</p>

<p>Good Mop did not look on
him with scorn when he saw
him in this sad way; but ran
up to him on three legs, with
one paw held out for "How
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
d'ye do," and his great fly-brush
of a tail a-wag for joy.</p>

<p>"Why, Frisk, old dog!" he
cried, "how glad I am to see
you! How have you been
this long time?"</p>

<p>"O Mop!" said Frisk in a
sad tone, "will you speak to
me now I am so poor? It
is I who am not fit to be
seen this time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
    "Frisk, my good dog," said
Mop in a grave tone, "<i>real</i>
worth is not a thing of looks.
Let me tell you that if I knew
you to steal a bone, you
would lose my good-will in
truth. But I do not look
down on dogs if they are
poor and good. Come home
with me; we can talk more
at our ease in my nice house,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
where you will find some first-rate
bones, if you would like
them."</p>

<p>"O yes! I guess I would!"
cried Frisk.</p>

<p>So the dogs set off on a
trot by the side of a fine lake,
on the banks of which the
town was built. They soon
came to a large house, with a
court-yard in front, tall green
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
rails all round, and a great
gate by which to go in. There
was a small gate near the large
one, the latch of which Mop
could lift with his nose, for
Frisk and him-self to pass;
and then the dogs ran round
to the back of the house. On
one side of the yard Frisk
saw a fine dog-house, fit for
the king, with a roof that ran
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to a peak, a porch in front,
and a dove-cote on a pole on
top. In-side there was a heap
of clean, warm hay, and on a
blue plate were some nice
bones.</p>

<p>"There!" said Mop, "don't
you call that prime? Help
your-self to the bones, Frisk;
I can get lots more."</p>

<p>Frisk did not wait to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
asked twice, but fell to, and
soon made way with the legs
of a fowl. When these were
gone, kind Mop ran to the
house and got a beef-bone for
him. Poor Frisk ate as if he
was not used to such fine fare,
and the good dog Mop, who
gave up his own meal to feed
Frisk, felt as glad as if he
had had it all him-self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
    When Frisk had made an
end of the bones, he and Mop
laid down in the dog-house;
and as Frisk had asked him
to do so, Mop told his tale,
as you shall hear.</p>

<p>But first he asked Frisk to
rise, so he could put more of
the soft hay on his side. "Do
you feel quite warm?" he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
    "O yes! thank you, dear
Mop," said Frisk; "as warm
as a toast. You will make
me cry, if you are so kind to
me. When you were poor, I
was a cross dog to you. Oh!
I can not bear to think how
bad I was;" and a great big
tear came out of each of
Frisk's eyes, and ran off at
the end of his nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
    "Oh! that is all gone. We
will be kind old dogs now,
and do all the good we can
in the world. And now here
goes for the grand tale of all
my joys and woes since I saw
you."</p>


<h3>MOP'S TALE.</h3>

<p>"You know, Frisk, that
when we left the court, you
chose to go in the town, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
I by the lake. I felt sad to
think I had no one to care
for me in the world. But my
watch-word is, 'Don't give it
up!' and I could not think
that all would leave me to
want a bone. So I laid down
by the road-side, in hopes to
see some one who would take
care of me.</p>

<p>"First, I saw a man on a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
fine horse; and as he had no
dog, I said to my-self, 'Who
knows but what he wants one
to keep the flies from his
horse's legs!' So I ran by
him a short way, when&mdash;would
you dream the man could be
so bad?&mdash;he gave me a cut
with his whip, that made me
hop and yelp for pain. 'Serve
you right for a vile cur!' he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
said with a loud laugh, and
on he rode.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i004.jpg" id="i004.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i004.jpg" width="500" height="665" alt="Moving on" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"There was no room for me, and I had to trot on."&mdash;<a name="P" id="P"></a><a href="#Page_88">P. 88</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Next came a blind man;
but he had a dog to lead him.
The blind man's hat was laid
on the ground, and when a
cent was put in it, the dog
gave one bark; when two
cents were put in, he gave
two barks, and so on. So,
you see, there was no room
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for me there, and I had to
trot on.</p>

<p>"At last I saw a small boy
and girl trip down the road,
hand in hand, with their
nurse close by them. They
wore such fine coats and hats,
that it was plain they were
rich; but when the boy put
his small hand on my head,
and said, 'Good dog,' and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
girl did the same, I knew they
must be kind too.</p>

<p>"So I ran by them, in
hopes they would speak to
me once more.</p>

<p>"There were some wild
rose-buds on the bank of the
lake, and when the girl saw
them she cried: 'O Hal! just
see those sweet rose-buds!
How nice they look! They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
have just come out! Won't
you pick me a few?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, dear May,' said
the boy; and he let go her
hand and ran to where the
rose-buds grew.</p>

<p>"'Don't go there, dear
child,' cried nurse; 'you may
fall in the lake.'</p>

<p>"'No I won't! I'll take
care,' cried Hal; and as he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
spoke he bent way down the
bank. O me! the earth gave
way, his foot did slip, and ere
the nurse could run to his aid,
the poor child fell, with a loud
cry, in the lake.</p>

<p>"There was no time to be
lost; and, more glad than I
can say, that I was on the
spot, I leapt in the lake, swam
to the side of the child, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in as short a time as it takes
to tell, I had his coat in my
teeth, and got him safe to
shore.</p>

<p>"The nurse took her dear
boy in her arms and cried for
joy; and May was so glad
that she put her arms round
my wet head, and gave me a
long hug.</p>

<p>"'We must take the good
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
dog home with us, Miss May,'
said nurse, 'and tell your pa-pa
what he has done for Hal.
And now let me wrap my
shawl round you, Hal, and
then we must all run home as
fast as we can, for fear you
may take cold.'</p>

<p>"We were soon at this
house, where Mr. and Mrs.
Grey, the pa-pa and mam-ma
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of Hal and May, live; and
nurse soon told them how I
had saved the life of their
dear son.</p>

<p>"You may think how great
was my joy to have them call
me, 'Good dog! brave dog!
the best dog in the world!'
and give me a hug and say I
must live with them from that
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
    "So Mr. Grey sent me out
with Hal to the yard; and he
got Jim, the groom, to wash
and trim me, while May ran
to ask the cook for some meat
to feed me. The dear child
did wish so much to make me
glad, that she tied her own
white bib round my neck to
keep me neat while I ate, and
fed me with her own hand;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
while Hal, and a wee bit of a
girl, who came to see them,
did look on.</p>

    <img src="images/i005.jpg" width="500" height="525" alt="Being fed" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"She fed me with her own hand."&mdash;<a href="#Page_46">P. 46</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"It was not quite as much
to my taste as hers to be fed;
but she was so full of the fun
of it, that I would not for the
world have made one growl.</p>

<p>"Next day their pa-pa got
me this nice house, and Hal
put round my neck the brass
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
ring you see me wear; which
they say has on it: 'To Dash,
the good dog, from Hal and
May.'"</p>

<p>When Mop, or Dash, as we
must now call him, had come
to an end, Frisk drew a deep
sigh, and said: "Well, Dash,
as that is your name, if I had
been as good as you, I might
be as well off by this time;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
but I think, when you hear
what a sad life I have led for
the past month, you will say
I am well paid for my fine
airs to you. So now to my
tale."</p>


<h3>FRISK'S TALE.</h3>

<p>"I made haste to the best
part of the town, when I left
you and the court, and, late
in the day, found my-self in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a fine place. Near the best
house was a group of three
small boys; they were at
play with some small, round,
smooth stones; and when one
stone hit the next, a boy
could cry out: 'That is mine!'</p>

<p>"Well, for my sins, I came
to a halt just in front of these
boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i006.jpg" id="i006.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i006.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="Group of boys" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"Near the best house was a group of three small boys."&mdash;<a href="#Page_50">P. 50</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"'Oh! oh! look at that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
nice dog!' cried one whose
name I found was Bob. 'I
guess he is lost. I mean to
have him for my dog.'</p>

<p>"'No, you shall not,' said
Ned, the next in size. 'He
shall be my dog.'</p>

<p>"'No, he shall be mine,'
said Sam. 'I want him! I
<i>will</i> have him!' and on that
they all tore up the steps of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the house, and burst in-to a
room where their mam-ma
was, with:</p>

<p>"'Ma, I want the dog!'</p>

<p>"'Ma, give me the dog!'</p>

<p>"'No, no, no, ma!&mdash;me!
me! me!'</p>

<p>"'O dear! what a noise!'
said their mam-ma. 'Do be
still. If you want the dog,
take him; but don't whine,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
or go on as if you all had
the tooth-ache.'</p>

<p>"All this time I was such
a gump, I sat quite still; but
when I saw the boys come
out and rush at me with rude
words, I said to my-self, 'Come
on, Frisk; I do not think it
will do to get a new place
here.' So I made up my
mind to take to my heels;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
when, O my dog-star! down
came a great bat on my head,
and the three boys fell on me
all at once; grab'd me by the
ears, tail, and one leg, at the
same time, and would have
torn me to bits, I am sure, if
their mam-ma had not come
and made Bob and Ned let
go.</p>

<p>"I was put in the front
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
room then, in a whole skin,
and here, in spite of all he
could do, I broke from Sam
and hid my-self at the back
of a couch that stood by the
fire-place.</p>

<p>"'Now what's to be done?'
said Sam.</p>

<p>"'Let's hunt him out with
sticks,' said Ned.</p>

<p>"'Good! come on!' cried
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Bob and Sam; and with-out
more words, Bob armed him-self
with the broom, and Ned
and Sam got canes, as if they
were in chase of some wild
beast, and all flew, with a loud
whoop! to bang poor me out
of my strong-hold.</p>

<p>"I don't know what would
have been my fate, if I had
not hit on what to do just in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
time. The sides and front
of the couch, by good luck,
came down past the seat, and
bands of broad tape were put
from side to side, to keep the
white slip in its place. I gave
a jump, made out to land on
the tapes, and sat on them
in great fear lest they might
give way.</p>

<p>"It was well I did so; for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the boys made their sticks fly
from side to side at such a
rate, that the first blow would
have been the death of me.
This game went on for some
time, till they were quite at a
loss to know why I did not
come out or make a cry.</p>

<p>"'Why where <i>can</i> he be?'
cried Sam. 'Look and see,
quick!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
    "Ned went down on his
knees&mdash;'Why he's gone!' he
said with a gasp.</p>

<p>"'O the b-a-a-d thing!'
cried Sam. 'Ma! ma! our
dog's lost! Boo! hoo! hoo!'
and to my great joy, all three
left the room to treat their
dear 'ma' to a howl. Oh!
how I <i>did</i> long to snap at
their legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
    "By this time so much fluff
and dust had got up my nose
in my close nook, that I was
fit to choke; and as the boys
were gone, I dared to come
out. There was a large arm-chair
close by, with a deep,
soft seat that was just to my
taste. I hopt in, laid down,
and was soon in a fine nap.</p>

<p>"Think, then, what was my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
state of mind to wake up with
a yell and a land-slide on top
of me! Up flew a fat old
dame from the arm-chair,
where she had just sat down,
as if she was shot! Bang!
came a great gilt book, that
she let fall in her start, right
on the end of my poor tail, as
I leapt to the floor! 'E-e-e!'
went she; 'yi! yi! yi!' went
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
I; and 'Hur-ra! here's the
dog!' cried Ned, as he came
bang in at the door, caught
me by one ear, and ran up to
the top floor with me in wild
joy; which put the last touch
to my woes!</p>

<p>"Once in their play-room,
the bad boys made me drag
a toy-cart full of dirt, ran
straws in-to my ears, beat me
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with sharp sticks, and shot
peas at me out of a pop-gun.
They kept up these nice plays
till tea-time; when they were
so kind as to let me go, and
treat me to a few old scraps
of cold meat for my share of
the meal.</p>

<p>"When tea was done, their
mam-ma bid them go right
to work and learn their tasks;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and, with pouts and whines
from all three, they sat down.
As soon as their mam-ma left
the room, Ned took out of
his desk a mouse-trap, with a
poor wee mouse in it, all in
a shake of fear, and cried:
'Here, Sam, just see what
I've got! An't that gay?'</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i007.jpg" id="i007.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i007.jpg" width="500" height="537" alt="Removes a mouse-trap" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"Ned took from his desk a mouse-trap."&mdash;<a href="#Page_64">P. 64</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"'What? what? let me
look!' cried Bob, who had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
sat till now with his legs
spread out, and a book be-fore
him up-side down.</p>

<p>"'No, you shan't. Go
'way!' said Ned, in a whine.</p>

<p>"'I will! I will!' Bob did
bawl; and as he spoke he did
jump up and give Ned's hair
a great pull! Then Sam gave
Bob a punch, and the three
boys did fight and kick each
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
other at a fine rate; in the
midst of which pow-wow I
left the room, and ran off
down the back stair.</p>

<p>"Here the maids were
more kind to me than the
boys; for cook made me a
nice soft bed in a box, and
gave me some bones to pick;
while Jane, the maid, took
me in her lap, and let me
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sleep there, snug and warm,
till she went to bed.</p>

<p>"But you could no more
guess what the next day had
in store for me, than you
could say how deep the sea
is; so I will tell you.</p>

<p>"Just as Jane came in with
the tea-tray, and cook had
got a tin pan to pour me
out some milk, down came
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
those vile boys full tilt, to
grab hold of me once more.
The kind cook asked them
to let me be, till I had had
my milk; but she might as
well have asked the wind not
to blow; and with Bob to
hold me, and Ned and Sam
to mount guard on each side,
they made haste once more
to the play-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
    "When they had me safe,
and the door shut, Bob cried
in great glee: 'Now, boys, I
tell you what we'll do: let's
play our dog was a slave, that
we had caught just as he was
on the point to run off. We
will tie him by the fore paws
and flog him well.'</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! how I felt when
I heard these words! My
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
hair stood on end with fear.
I threw my-self on the floor,
and cried for help. Ah me!
no help came. One would
think they might have felt
for a poor dog that could not
help it-self. But no; they
were with-out heart.</p>

<p>"Bob found a cord, and
tied my feet to a large nail
in the wall. Ned and Sam
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
did each fetch the strap that
they had round their task-books,
and then these bad
boys beat me till I felt as if
I must die.</p>

<p>"At last they heard their
mam-ma call from her room,
'Boys, boys, come right to
your tasks&mdash;it is past nine
o'clock;' for she did teach
them her-self I found out.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
At the sound of her voice,
they left off, and ran to the
door to beg for a short time
more.</p>

<p>"Now was my time at last.
I freed my paws by a great
jerk, shot past Sam's legs,
flew down the stair, and out
of the house; for by great
good luck, Jane had just gone
to the door to let in the post-man.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
I am glad to say I
sent Sam too down the stair
like a shot, with a boot-jack
and a pair of tongs, which
Ned and Bob threw, and which
were meant for me, at his
heels. This made up, in part,
for the pain he had put me
to. But, oh! how sore and
lame I was! I sank on the
earth when I was clear out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of sight, and felt as if my
death was near. If it had
not been for what next took
place, my end would have
come that day; but as I lay
there all in a shake, I heard
a child's voice say: 'O dear
Fred! here is such a poor
dog! Just see! he looks
half dead! Let us stop and
pat him!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
    "'Dear me! Poor toad!'
cried Fred. 'Where could he
have come from? Pat him
well; don't fear.'</p>

<p>"Her soft hand on my
head made me raise my eyes,
and I saw a boy and girl of
nine and ten years old. They
did not seem to be rich, but
they were just as neat and
nice as two pins, and their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
kind looks and words made
me feel sure they were good.</p>

<p>"'Poor dog! I fear he
wants food,' went on Nell. 'I
mean to give him a bit to eat,
Fred.'</p>

<p>"'Let me feed him too!'
cried the boy. 'Here, take
my knife and cut some bread
for him.'</p>

<p>"Nell took a loaf from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
bag on her arm, and with
Fred's knife cut off a good
thick slice. She gave half
to him, and they broke it in
bits and fed me by turns.</p>

<p>"'You dear pet,' said Nell,
with a sigh, 'how I wish I
could take you with me! But
we are too poor; it can not
be.'</p>

<p>"'Oh! don't you think
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
mam-ma would let us have
him?' cried Fred.</p>

<p>"'No, dear,' said Nell; 'we
must not think of it. Come,
bid the dog good-by, and let
us make haste home.'</p>

<p>"I could but lick her hand
to thank her for the food, and
as I could rise now, I felt that
it was best to run on.</p>

    <p class="caption2">"Good-by, dear doggy!"&mdash;<a href="#Page_78">P. 78</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"'Good-by, you dear doggy!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
cried both; and they did
stand and watch me till I
was out of their sight. Oh!
how I did wish I could go
home with them!</p>

<p>"Just as I did turn round
the end of the street, I heard
an odd sound&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Frisk rose in haste
and said: "But I dare not
stay, dear Dash; I ought now
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to be at home. Some day
when I can get out, I will
come and tell you the rest
of my sad tale, for the worst
part is yet to come."</p>

<p>"But where must you go,
Frisk?" said Dash.</p>

<p>"Why, to the show, where
I play," said Frisk.</p>

<p>"You play! Can you
act?" cried Dash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
    "Yes! come out-side. Now,
just see here!" and while
Dash did stare at him, with
his mouth and eyes so wide
open that you would not
think he could close them
at all, Frisk stood on his hind
legs, and went thro' a jig, with
a look on his face as if he had
lost his last hope; then fell
down on the grass, stiff and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
stark, as if he had been shot;
got up, made a low bow, and
then went lame on three legs.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Dash,
"how smart you are! Where
<i>did</i> you learn all that?"</p>

<p>"It would take a long time
to tell," said Frisk. "If I can,
I will come and see you next
week, and you shall then hear
all. Now, good-by."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
    "Here, take this nice sweet
bone with you," cried Dash.
"Good-by, old chap. I hope
I shall see you soon;" and the
good dog went back to his
house, full of Frisk's tale. He
tried so hard to think of a
way to do him some good,
that he got quite a bald spot
on the top of his head, and
at last laid down with his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
nose in his paws, to sleep on
it, and dream of bones with-out
end; for, you know, he
gave up his own to feed one
worse off than him-self. Good
Dash! I hope each dear girl
and boy who reads this will
try to be like him, for that
is the way to be loved by
all.</p>

<h2>PART III.</h2>
<h3>DASH SEES A PLAY.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
    <a name="i009.jpg" id="i009.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i009.jpg" width="75" height="46" alt="Illustrated letter T" title="" />
</div>
<p>he same eve, when
Mr. Grey came home
he said in a sly way:
"I see there is a show of
dogs, who dance and act a
play, in town; but Hal and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
May do not care to see them,
I know."</p>

<p>"O yes! yes! we want to
go!" cried both at once. "Do
take us to see them, pa-pa."</p>

<p>"Well, get your hats then,"
said Mr. Grey, "and we will
go."</p>

<p>"Let's take Dash," said
May. "He wants to see the
dog-show too!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
    Her pa-pa said, with a
laugh, that he did not think
Dash would care to see a
play; but Hal and May did
beg so hard, that at last he
said they might take Dash if
they chose.</p>

<p>So the two ran up the stair
in high glee to their nurse,
who put on May's round straw
hat and silk sack, and got
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
her nice black mitts to put
on her wee hands.</p>

<p>May said, "I want to put on
my mitts my-self, nurse;" so
nurse said she might do so,
and went on to dress Hal.</p>

<p>But when May went to put
the mitts on, she was in such
haste, that she tried to get the
right mitt on the left hand.
The mitt would not go on, of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
course, and she cried out:
"Why, nurse, this is all
wrong; it's got no thumb
at all!"</p>

<p>How Hal and nurse did
laugh when they saw what
May had done! May had to
laugh too, when nurse did
show her that the mitts were
quite right, if they were put
on in the right way. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
had great fun. But their pa-pa
came to bid them make
haste; so they told nurse
good-by, and ran down the
stair, hand in hand, as gay
as two larks. Dash came to
join them in the court-yard,
and soon they were all four
on their way to the show.</p>

<p>But, dear me! when the
man at the door of the show
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
saw Dash, he said: "I can't
let dogs in, sir."</p>

<p>Here was a blow! and May,
with her sweet blue eyes quite
sad, cried out: "But you will
let our Dash in, Mr. Show-man,
won't you? You don't know
what a good dog he is; he
saved Hal's life!"</p>

<p>Now when the show-man
heard dear May say this, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
saw her sweet face and blue
eyes raised to his, he could not
help a smile, and said: "Well,
for such a dear pet, I must
say, yes. Dash may go in,
but he must lie still and make
no noise. One bark, and out
he goes!"</p>

<p>"Oh! he will be as still
as a deaf and dumb mouse!"
cried Hal and May both at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
once. So, to the great joy
of all, Dash went in. Hal and
May took their seats with
their pa-pa on a long bench,
in a large room full of gay
folks, and Dash sat on the
floor close by them.</p>

<p>There was a stage at one
end of the room; a fall of
green baize hung in front of
it. In a short time a bell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
went "ting-a-ling! ting-a-ling!"
and up rose the baize. Then
Dash saw a small house, with
a grape-vine at the side and
tall trees, which he took for
real ones, but Mr. Grey said
were wood and green paint.
You could see a green field at
the back of the stage, and high
hills, while the blue sky was as
clear as it was out of doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
    Mr. Grey had a bill with the
names of the dogs that were
to act on it, and Dash heard
him read it to Hal and May.</p>

<p>The name of the play was:</p>

<table class="toc" summary="Casting">
<caption>THE DEATH OF POOR JACK,<br />THE RUN-A-WAY.</caption>
<tr><td class="c1 smcap">Jack,</td><td class="c3 smcap">Frisk.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c1 smcap">Col. Grape-shot,</td><td class="c3 smcap">Trip.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c1 smcap">The Guard,</td><td class="c3 smcap">Tray and Wasp.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="c1 smcap">The Judge,</td><td class="c3 smcap">Short.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
    Dash, when he found Frisk
was to act, scarce drew a
breath for fear he should
lose a bit of the play, and
sat so still that not a hair
moved.</p>

<p>First, in came two dogs
on their hind-legs as the
guard, in red coats and caps
and blue pants. They had
guns too; and they had such
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
an odd look with their own
tails up in the air out-side
their coat-tails, and their
head held as stiff as ram-rods
to keep their caps on,
that all the folks burst out in
a laugh.</p>

<p>Then the guard did peep
round all the trees, and in all
the holes they could find, on
a hunt for Jack; and when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they did not find him, they
shook their heads as if to
say: "No one here! that's a
fact!"</p>

<p>At last one of the guard
went to rap at the door of
the house. He gave such a
hard knock, that he shook his
cap down on one eye, and
had to hold his head on one
side, as if he had the tooth-ache,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
so as to see at all. It
made him feel so bad, that
he went off in a pet to the
back of the stage, and left
the guard whose cap was all
right to knock for him-self.
This one was so short, that
he had to make a jump and
stand on tip-toe to do it.</p>

<p>Out came a dog in the
dress of an old dame, who,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Mr. Grey said, was Jack's
mam-ma. She wore a black
gown, a white cap, and plaid
shawl, and had a work-bag
on her arm, or fore-leg, and
a big pair of specs tied on
her nose. When she saw the
guard, she spread out her
paws, and gave each a look
in turn, as if to ask what
they came there for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
    The short guard made signs
to her, to show they were on
a hunt for a man who had
left the camp with-out leave.
The old dame shook her head
at this, and put a paw on her
heart, as if to say <i>she</i> hadn't
heard of such a thing; but
the one-eyed guard shook <i>his</i>
head too, and did point thro'
the door, as much as to say
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
that the man was in <i>there</i>, he
was sure. Then the old dame
shook her head once more,
and spread her skirt to keep
them out of the house; but
the guard were too smart for
that. They aimed their guns
at the wall of the house, to
shoot Jack if he was in-side;
and when the old dame saw
that, she moved from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
door-way, with a high squeak,
and let them pass.</p>

<p>In they went full tilt, and
the one-eyed guard, in his
haste, quite lost sight of his
part, let fall his gun, and ran
off on all four legs! It pains
me to tell that a sad yelp was
heard in-side the house, as if
he had got a box on the ear
for this fault; and Dash could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
not but think that to act was
not such fine fun as you
might take it to be.</p>

<p>Soon out came the guard,
with Jack held fast by both
fore-legs, and the old dame
at their backs, who cried with
all her might and main. The
run-a-way, who was Frisk to
be sure, wore a coat and cap
like the guard, and made a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
sad noise at his hard fate.
He put his paw on his heart,
and cast up his eyes as if to
beg them to let him off; but
they shook their heads. Then
he held out both paws to his
mam-ma, and she ran to him,
put her paws round his neck,
and did kiss him as well as
she could. The guard gave
him a pull to make him come.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Frisk did kiss his paw and
wave his cap to his mam-ma,
who fell down in a swoon;
and then they all three did
march off. And that was the
end of Part One.</p>

<p>Just as the scene was to
close, the old dame did lift up
her head and fore-paws and
look round. When she saw it
was not time, she fell down
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
once more; so flat, that all
the folks burst out in a laugh.
I fear they would not have
been so gay if they knew
how the poor dog was beat
by the show-man, when the
play was done, for this small
fault.</p>

<p>Next came a horn-pipe by
a dog in a Scotch dress. He
did it so well, that all the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
folks did clap their hands, and
want him to do it once more;
but it was now time for Part
Two of the play; and he ran
off with a low bow.</p>

<p>When the baize was drawn
up once more, the small house
was gone, and a high desk
was set on one side of the
stage, with a bench in front
for Col. Grape-shot. And at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the desk sat the judge who
was to try Jack for his life.
The dog who was judge wore
a fine black silk gown, with
white fur down the front; he
had white bands at his neck,
and a great white wig on top
of his ears, which made him
look droll, I can tell you.</p>

<p>And now, O dear! the deep
roll of a drum was heard, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in came, one by one, a sad set
in-deed!</p>

<p>First did march the dog
who beat the drum, and next
to him Col. Grape-shot, in a
grand blue and gold coat; a
gold-laced hat, with red and
white plumes; white pants,
with a red stripe down each
leg, and a sword by his side.</p>

<p>Then came the guard with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Jack, and, last of all, a dog
with a long box in a hand-cart,
which he drew. O dear!
dear! this was to put poor
Jack in when he was dead.
The dog wore a black coat
and an old red night-cap;
and tied fast to one leg was
a spade. He led the poor
mam-ma by the paw, and
once in a while tried to cheer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
her up; for he would lift his
leg and give her a kind pat
on the back with the end of
his spade. But I think this
did more harm than good, for
each time he did so she gave
a short howl, and half fell
down. But now the guard,
with Jack and Col. Grape-shot,
were in a row in front
of the judge, who waved his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
paw, and made a bow, as
much as to say: "Go on."</p>

<p>Col. Grape-shot, on this, did
first point to Jack, and then
pat the bench he sat on, as
much as to say he had bid
him stay in the camp. Then
he shut his eyes, and leant
his head on his right paw, to
show that he went to sleep,
and then he made two or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
three quick steps to the back
of the stage, to let them know
that Jack had run off while
he slept. Then he shut his
eyes once more, woke up
with a start, flew to the guard,
and, with a bark and a growl
and a yap! yap! yap! let
them know that Jack had cut
off, and they must go and find
him. Then he did point to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the guard and Jack, to tell
the judge that the run-a-way
was found; and at last he
made a low bow, and spread
out his paws, by which, I dare
say, he meant that his part
was at an end.</p>

<p>And now it was the turn
of the judge, and he must
say what was to be done to a
man who was so bad as to run
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
out of camp in time of war.
The judge cast up his eyes,
and threw up his paws, as if
it was a sad shock to him to
hear that Jack had been so
bad. Then he did point to
the guns of the guard and to
Jack, and did nod his head
as if he would nod it off. It
was too plain! Poor Jack
must be shot!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
    His mam-ma, when she saw
this, ran to the judge and fell
on her knees; that is, she sat
down on her hind-legs, with
her paws held out, to beg him
to let Jack off; but he shook
his head "no." Then she did
the same to Col. Grape-shot;
but it was all of no use. Jack
put his paws round her neck,
and did kiss her good-by, at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
which Hal and May cried quite
hard, and then gave him-self
up to the guard. They took
him to the back of the stage,
put a white cloth on his eyes,
and made him kneel down.
Then they stood in front of
him, side by side, put up their
guns, and, flash! bang!! off
went two shots; and poor Jack
fell dead on the stage!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i010.jpg" id="i010.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i010.jpg" width="500" height="698" alt="Shots fired" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"Flash!, bang! off went two shots!"&mdash;<a href="#Page_118">P. 118</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
    Down popt his mam-ma
once more in a swoon; while
the guard took off the lid of
the box, and put Jack in-side,
who laid as stiff as a ram-rod.
The dog who drew the hand-cart
put on the lid, and went
off first; then the Col. and
judge, arm in arm; then the
guard, who had to drag Jack's
mam-ma by the arms, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
didn't seem to like it much;
and last, the dog who beat the
drum and who did bang a-way
for dear life all the time.</p>

<p>But just as the folks were
quite in tears for the fate of
poor Jack, in came the dog
with the hand-cart full tilt,
and in a great scare; for the
lid of the box was half off,
and you could see one of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Jack's paws stuck out of a
crack on top. All at once,
off flew the lid, and out came
Jack in a new dress, to dance
a jig, and show that he had
come to life once more, and
was just as good as new.</p>

<p>Oh! how the folks did
laugh at this, and clap their
hands! while Jack went on
to show all his queer tricks.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
First, he held up both his
legs on his right side, and
took a walk with the two on
his left side; then he leapt
thro' a ring or hoop, that was
let down from the top of the
stage, and took a turn round
in the air as he went; and, by
way of a wind up, he stood
on his head in the ring, and
let him-self be drawn up out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of sight, as the green baize
came down.</p>

<p>O dear! how much May
and Hal liked all this, while
Dash did not know how in
the world Frisk could do it;
and when all the boys and
girls were as full as they
could hold of the fun of the
thing, Dash had as much as
he could do to keep in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
howl of grief; for, you must
know, the dog could tell by
poor Frisk's face that all this
was no fun to him.</p>

<p>And now the show was
done, and it was time to
go home.</p>

<p>As they went, May and
Hal had a nice long talk.
May said: "O dear Hal! how
I wish we had a dog that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
knew how to dance! What
fun, when Sue and Kate
Brown came, to have him
show off!"</p>

<p>"Dear pa-pa, do buy one
for us, won't you?" said Hal.
"O my! buy that queer dog&mdash;what
was his name?&mdash;the one
that stood on two legs, and
on the top of his head, and
was shot&mdash;that one!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
    When Dash heard Hal ask
his pa-pa to buy Frisk, his
heart went pit-a-pat, and he
gave a short, glad bark,
which meant, "O yes! <i>do</i> buy
Frisk!"</p>

<p>"But," said pa-pa, "you
know that Frisk acts 'Jack,
the Run-a-way;' and what if
I should buy him, and he
should trot off the next day!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
You know Dash could not
have a red coat on, and run
on his hind-legs to bring Frisk
back; and what would you do
then?"</p>

<p>Then Dash did wish with
all his might that he could
talk, "O dear!" he said to
him-self; "I would give all
my ears, and half my nose, if
I could let them know that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Frisk would not run off;" and
then, strange to say, his love
and wish to help Frisk made
him get up on his hind-legs,
and put his fore-paws up in
the air; and he gave such a
droll whine, that May and Hal
burst out in a laugh, and said,
"Look, pa-pa! just look at
Dash! He too begs you to
buy Frisk!" and then they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
both went and stood one on
each side of the dog, put their
hands up, and made such a
queer whine just like him, that
it was the best fun in the
world to see and hear them.</p>

<p>"But," said pa-pa, "if the
show-man will sell him to me,
do you not know it would be
wrong to make the poor dog
keep up his tricks?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
    "Wrong! why how, pa-pa?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dears, it seems
too sad a thing to tell you,
but it is too true. The show-man
has to beat his dogs, and
starve them, to get them to
learn the tricks that made
you laugh so much. You
saw how thin they were, and
you heard them cry out, when
they left the stage. If they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
made the least slip or mis-take,
they got a hard blow
for it. In this way they find
out that they must do all their
tricks quite right, or they will
have the whip laid on their
poor thin sides and heads;
and so not a day goes by that
the dogs are not starved and
made to feel the whip.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" cried Hal and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
May, "we did not know that.
<i>We</i> would not beat or starve
a dog, or a cat, or a worm.
What a bad show-man! We
would like to beat <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope not," said pa-pa.
"The show-man may not
think that dogs feel as much
as we do. But I know you
will be kind to all. I know
you would not strike Dash,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
if he, by chance, broke one
of your toys or hurt you in
play."</p>

<p>"O no! in-deed," they both
cried; and they ran up to the
dog, and gave him a good
hug, and a kiss on the top
of his head.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Dash
had not lost one word of all
this talk; and he was still
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
more sad when he knew how
much poor Frisk had to bear.
He made up his mind to tell
Frisk to run off, and come to
him. "I will hide him in my
house till the show-man goes,"
he said to him-self. "I saw
a great ham-bone on the shelf
to-day. I know it will fall to
my share, and, oh! won't it
be good! I will give this to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Frisk, and eat bits of bread.
Yes, I will save up all the
nice bones for him. Was he
not a good <a name="dog" id="dog"></a>dog?"</p>

<p>But a whole week went by,
and no Frisk. The ham-bone
got quite dry; and Dash was
sure poor Frisk must be ill or
dead.</p>

<p>At last one day, when Dash
had lost all hope, he heard the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
pit-a-pat of four small feet in
the yard. He had just gone
in his house to take a short
nap; but, I can tell you, he
made but one jump out, for
there was Frisk, on all fours,
to be sure, but with his blue
pants on his hind-legs, his
red coat on his fore-legs, with
the coat-tails, one on each
side of his own tail, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
was up in the air in an arch
of joy, for here he was a real,
true run-a-way.</p>

<p>Dash flew to meet him.
"Why, Frisk!" he cried;
"make haste&mdash;fast&mdash;come&mdash;get
right in my house.
Don't mind if you tear those
old coat-tails with the thorn-bush.
There! that's the thing!&mdash;here
you are, all safe!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Now tell me, how <i>did</i> you
get off?"</p>

<p>Frisk had run so fast that
he could not speak; he could
just pant, and lay his head
on Dash's, with a look full
of love. At last he said:
"O Dash! I have run off in
the midst of the play&mdash;the
show-man struck me so hard
for what I could not help&mdash;for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
my cap fell off&mdash;and I did
think I must die with the
pain. O Dash! if you knew
what I have gone thro', your
heart would break, and you
would say, I did right to run
a-way." The big tears ran
down his nose, and his sobs
did seem as if they would
choke him; and Dash gave
such a long howl of woe,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that it makes me cry as I
write these words, and I am
quite sure you will cry as you
read them.</p>

<p>Then Dash got out all his
best bones to feed poor Frisk,
who ate as if he had not seen
a bone an inch long in a
month.</p>

<p>When he had done, Dash
said: "Now, dear Frisk, if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
you feel like it, tell me all
you have gone thro'."</p>

<p>So they sat down, and while
the tears ran down Dash's
nose, Frisk told the rest of
his sad tale.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<h2>PART IV.</h2>
<h3>THE CONCLUSION OF FRISK'S TALE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
    <a name="i011.jpg" id="i011.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i011.jpg" width="75" height="217" alt="Illustrated letter Y" title="" />
</div>
<p>ou will bear in mind,
Dash, that I left off
where the good child fed
me with bread. Well,
this made me strong, and I
went on my way. Soon I
heard a sound, like that of a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
flute or fife; it was quite
near, but I could see no one.
All at once, a great mob of
boys and men came down the
road, and made a crowd close
by me. I went in the midst
of them to find out what it all
meant. Dear me! it was
some-thing queer to be sure.
There was a man with a big
drum fast to his back, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
he beat with a drum-stick tied
to one of his feet. In the
front of his coat was a set
of Pan's pipes, out of which
he blew the tune the old cow
died of. In his left hand he
held a whip, while in his right
was a cord, which led three
dogs. The first one was an
old dog, with bow-legs, who
when the crowd did stop, got
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
up on his hind-legs, and gave
a look round at the two be-hind,
who stood, right up on
their hind-legs, all in a grave,
glum way. One of these was
in the dress of a girl. She
had on a large round hat, full
of big red bows. The hat
was so big, and shook so
much, that it did seem as if
her head, hat, and all, would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
drop off, if it got a hard
knock.</p>

<p>"The dog with the bow-legs
wore a blue coat, a flat
hat with a broad brim, and
such a high shirt col-lar, that
the sharp ends all but put his
eyes out. He had a pair of
specs tied on his black nose
with twine. The third had on
a cap and coat like those of a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
small boy. And all did look
as if they were on their way
to be hung.</p>

<p>"Then the man made a jig
tune on his pipe, and beat the
drum with his foot till he was
as red as fire in the face,
while the dogs kept time with
hop, skip, and jump, with one
eye on the whip.</p>

<p>"The men and boys were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
full of the fun. O dear! how
they did clap their hands and
laugh! and I, great goose that
I was, stood on <i>my</i> hind-legs,
to try how it felt, and kept
near the dogs all day, and saw
them dance at least ten times.</p>

<p>"At last, when the sun had
set, the man came to an old
house, and let him-self in with
a key; the dogs went in too,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
while I stood out-side on two
legs, to try to peep thro' a
small crack in the door.
Soon there came&mdash;oh! such a
good smell of hot beef-bones.
I felt as if I would give all
four of my legs for just one
bone.</p>

<p>"I gave the door a push,
and found it moved; and
then, to make a long tale
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
short, I went in; for I said to
my-self: 'The man may beat
me to death, but if I stay
here I shall starve to death;
so I can but try for a bone.'</p>

<p>"I found my-self in a low,
dark room. The walls were
black with dirt and smoke.
The dogs lay in one part of
the room, and the man sat
by the fire. On a hook was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a great pot, and from this
came such a nice smell, that
all the dogs, and I with them,
did lick our lips the whole
time.</p>

<p>"And now there came in
the room an old dame, with a
dry, brown face, for all the
world like the nut-shell dolls
the pie-man's boy used to
make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
    "'Well, John,' she said,
'have you had a good day?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, Gran-ny; I took a
hat full of cents. See here,
what a lot of them! But
that dog there, he lost me
a three cent piece to-day;
so he goes with-out his bone.'</p>

<p>"The poor dog with the
bow-legs gave a great howl
when he heard this; but the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
show-man hit him on the nose
with his whip, and he slunk
off, while the big tears ran in
a stream down his face.</p>

<p>"The rest stood on their
hind-legs in a row, while the
old dame with the nut-shell
face took the pot from the fire.</p>

<p>"'Here,' said she to the
show-man, 'hold the dish
while I pour the stew out.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
    "Oh! how it did smoke!
and what a fine smell it had!
The man got a loaf of bread
and two blue plates from the
shelf, and a knife and fork for
each; and then they went to
work to eat as fast as they
could, while the dogs and I
did look on with all the eyes
we had. When the show-man
had eat-en all he could,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
he took some more meat, cut
it up in bits, and said: 'Now,
I shall give each dog a bit in
turn. Look sharp you! If
the wrong dog starts when I
call, he gets none at all. Now
then, Pete!'</p>

<p>"The dog in the cap made
a jump and one snap, and the
meat was gone.</p>

<p>"'Now then, Hop!' said
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the man; and the dog in
the girl's hat got it; and
then it was Pete's turn, while
poor Bob with the bow-legs,
who lost the three cents, kept
up a kind of soft howl and
a sob, as if his heart would
break.</p>

<p>"All this time I did think
I must die for want of food,
and I made up my mind to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
stand on my hind-legs till the
show-man gave me some meat
too. So I got up and did not
fall, while you could count
ten, then I ran up to the
show-man, and stood on my
hind-legs at his side.</p>

<p>"'Why bless me, dame!'
he cried, 'where did this dog
come from?'</p>

<p>"'Where to be sure,' said
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the dame; 'you let him in
your-self.'</p>

<p>"'Did I, Gran-ny? Well,
that is queer. I did not see
him. He seems to know how
to stand up&mdash;sit down, sir.'</p>

<p>"Down I went like a flash.</p>

<p>"'Get up, sir,' and up I
got once more as stiff as a
po-ker.</p>

<p>"'Why don't you take him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
for one of your set,' said the
old dame. 'He must be lost,
for just see here! his name is
on the brass ring round his
neck.' Then she put on a
pair of old horn specs to spell
my name out. 'F-r-i-s-k Frisk;
what a nice name! and what a
clean, trim chap he is! Why,
John, he would be a great help
to you, he seems so smart.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
    "'So he would,' said the
man. 'He would soon learn
to dance, and he knows now
how to stand up. I can soon
teach him more. Here, you,
sir! take that!' and he threw
me a large bit of meat, which
I was glad to get, you may be
sure. Then I took the rest
of my share in my turn with
Pete and Hop, and, O dear!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
how nice it was, and how
glad I was to get it!</p>

<p>"When we had eat all up,
the show-man took off the hats
and coats of his dogs, and
sent them and me to sleep in
a large flat box, that stood at
the end of the room. It was
full of straw and quite nice.</p>

<p>"Then the man sat down
by the fire to smoke his pipe
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and have a chat with his old
brown nut-shell Gran-ny.</p>

<p>"I was so glad to rest, that
I went fast to sleep right off.
But, O dear! O dear! the
next morn, it was sad as it
could be, for I had to learn
to dance a jig, and stand on
my head, and he beat me so,
that I had a fit. I did think
he would break each bone I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
had, and the more I cried the
more he beat me.</p>

<p>"But I had to learn; and
in two weeks' time I went out
with the rest.</p>

<p>"One day the same man I
ran from to-day saw me
dance in the street. He was
a big show-man, and had dog
plays, and was quite rich and
great; so he tried to buy me.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I heard him tell <i>my</i> man, that
the dog who used to play
'Jack, the Run-a-way,' was
just dead, and I would make
a first-rate Jack in his place.</p>

<p>"So he paid, I don't know
how much, and got me, and
set me to learn my part. O
my dear Dash! my life was
one scene of hard blows and
hard fare. The poor wee dog
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
who acts the old dame in the
play is worse off than I, for
she is so weak, that she can
not do her part well; and oh!
how he beats her! She has
told me more than once that
she would be glad to die, and
I get quite wild when I think
I can not help her. If the
bad man would whip me for
her, I would be glad to take
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
it, tho' I get blows all the
time for my own share."</p>

<p>"Oh! how sad!" cried Dash,
the big tears in his eyes.
"What a bad, bad man! How
glad I am you have run
a-way from him. But what
shall we do to hide you?"</p>

<p>"Dear Dash, if you will
keep me here for four or five
days, I may get some one to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
take me, who is as good and
kind as Mr. Grey, and then
some day I will try to show
you how much I feel what
you <i>have</i> done and <i>will do</i>
for me."</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it," said
Dash. "It is as much of a
joy to <i>do</i> good as to have
good done to one's self. You
shall stay here with me, dear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Frisk! and we will wait and
see what comes of it."</p>

<p>"O you good old dog!
you dear Dash! I will stay in
your house all the time. I will
be as still as a drum with a
hole in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I know you will
come out all right at last. I
tell you what! I heard May
and Hal ask their pa-pa to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
buy you. O my! they want
you so much!"</p>

<p>"Do they? O dear! then
I can stay here all the rest of
my life." And in his joy he
tried to stand on his head;
but the roof of the dog-house
was too low, and his legs came
down on top of Dash's back,
and gave him quite a start.</p>

<p>"But," said Dash, "I must
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
tell you that May and Hal
said you were to dance for
them."</p>

<p>"O dear! if that is all, I
will dance the whole day for
a good home."</p>

<p>So the two dogs kept house
for a week, and Dash went
out and got the bones, while
Frisk made the straw beds,
and swept the scraps out with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
his paws for a broom. Not
the tip of his nose did he
show in the day-time, but at
night he took a run round the
lawn to get the twist out of
his legs.</p>

<p>The fat old cook in the
house said she did not know
how Dash could eat so much;
for he would beg for bones five
or six times a day. She was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a good old soul, and she gave
him all the bones she had, and
he would lick her hand and
wag his tail, and all but speak
to thank her.</p>

<p>At last one day, Dash heard
Mr. Grey say that the show-man
had gone a-way. He
had tried his best to find
Frisk. He said he would give
a large sum to get him back;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and all the boys in town went
out to hunt the poor dog.
But they did not find him, as
you and I know.</p>

<h2>PART V.</h2>
<h3>FRISK FINDS A NEW HOME.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
    <a name="i012.jpg" id="i012.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i012.jpg" width="75" height="83" alt="Illustrated letter A" title="" />
</div>
<p>nd now, as I shall
tell you, one day
May and Hal went
out on the lawn,
when lo! there stood Frisk,
first on his hind-legs, and then
on his head; then he danced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a jig, and then ran up to lick
their hands.</p>

<p>"O my! O look! here is
that dear Jack we saw in the
play," cried May.</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is! Why, Jack,
where <i>did</i> you hide all this
time?" said Hal, and he gave
him a soft pat, and May put
her white arms round his
neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
    Tears of joy stood in Frisk's
eyes, and he ran with May
and Hal and Dash up to the
house, where their pa-pa and
mam-ma were.</p>

<p>You may be sure the two
went hard to work to kiss and
coax pa-pa to let Jack or
Frisk stay. They asked him
to look how thin the poor dog
was, and how sad it would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
be to send him back to the
show-man, who would beat
him, and may-be kill him, he
would be in such a rage.</p>

<p>"O now, dear pa-pa! do
let him live with us!" they
cried; "<i>we</i> will not beat him,
and he may dance or not, as
he likes. Come, we will kiss
you ten times;" and they both
got his face down, and gave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
them to him on each cheek at
the same time, and made him
and mam-ma laugh so, they
could not speak a word for
quite a while.</p>

<p>Well, the end of all this
long tale is, that Mr. Grey
wrote to the show-man, and
said he had got his dog, Frisk,
and he would like to keep
him. I do not dare to tell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
you how much he said he
would give to buy him; but
it was such a large sum, that
the show-man took it. And
now Jack&mdash;Frisk, as they call
him&mdash;and Dash have each
a house to live in, but they
eat and take their naps in one,
for they love to get as close,
side by side, as they can.
Frisk stands on his hind-legs
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and his head, and does his jig
dance in great style for May
and Hal, and all the boys
and girls who come to see
them. If <i>you</i> want to see
him, you must speak quick;
for I fear he will soon be so fat,
with all the nice bones and
kind words he gets, that his
hind-legs won't hold him up.
But of this you may be quite
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
sure, that Frisk and Dash will
have a good home as long as
they live, and when they die
of old age, if you don't cry
for their sad loss, May and
Hal will; for, you know, Dash
saved Hal's life; and life is
dear to the young when they
have no sad times, but joy
and fun each day.</p>

<p>And now May, and Hal,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and Dash, and Frisk, must bid
you good-by. If you want
to hear how they get on, you
must come and tell me, and
if you give me a good kiss,
I will let you know.</p>

<p>Good-by! my dear pets!
May the good God bless you
all.</p>
